/* 
    The MAX6369â€“MAX6374 are pin-selectable watchdog timers that supervise microprocessor (uP)  activity and signal when a system is operating improperly. During normal operation, the microprocessor should repeatedly toggle the watchdog input (WDI) before the selected watchdog timeout period elapses to demonstrate that the system is processing code properly. If the uP does not provide a valid watchdog input transition before the timeout period expires, the supervisor asserts a watchdog (WDO) output to signal that the system is not executing the desired instructions within the expected time frame.
